# Lighthall SESL 2 Level 2 Assignment

## Requirements
As a User I want a web application where I can enter the state of my assets portfolio at some day in the past and see how much money would be worth today.

## Example
Start Date: 2013-03-20 <br>
Initial Balance:$32500 <br>
Portfolio Allocation: 20% AAPL, 50% GOOG, 30% MSFT <br>
Please make a small app where the user can enter this data and can get the results. Feel free to visualize the output as you see fit (Aggregate portfolio returns chart, Portfolio Allocation evolution over time, etc). <br>
<br>
To obtain the historical returns you can use this free API https://www.worldtradingdata.com/
